Project Overview

The goal is to enhance the application with multi-country functionality where users can select a country, and the data they work with is tagged with that country. The country selection should persist across sessions, and role-based access should ensure that Admins have full data management capabilities, while Viewers only have read-only access to data related to their assigned country.
